		<description><![CDATA[It is indeed a good post for the consumers, but the last answer on certifications vs price is not correctly stated, infact it is incorrect, Being from the industry, I find it inappropriate to state the answer the way it is currently framed.
there is a lot of difference in price depending on which lab it is certified by. A solitaire certified by a local lab in India or international level diamond grading laboratories, that is not just due to the fact that the price is paid for certification but this depends on a worldwide listing called RAPAPORT]]></description>
